\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This thesis never would have seen the light of day without the assistance and encouragement from a number of people.

First of these, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Carlos Herdeiro for always being available to answer questions and most of all, giving me the opportunity to perform research.

Special thanks go to Eugen Radu without whose help this thesis would be nothing but empty pages.
Your willingness to help and explain when I had (numerical) problems can not be overstated.
I would also like to thank the rest of the gravitation and high energy physics group at the University of Aveiro for fostering the perfect environment for a PhD student to thrive in.
There are, in no particular order: Jo\~ao Rosa, Pedro Cunha, Juan Carlos Degollado, Jai Grover, Marco Sampaio, Antonia Morais, Fl\'avio Coelho, Carolina Benone and Mengjie Wang.

During my PhD, I visited various places and in particular I would like to thank Luis Crispino for his hospitality during my two visits to Bel\'em do Par\'a in Brazil.

I would like to acknowledge the financial support from Funda\c{c}\~ao para a Ci\^encia e a Tecnologia (FCT)--the International Doctorate Network in Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology (IDPASC) programme, with the grant SFRH/BD/109532/2015 during the completion of this thesis.

And lastly, I would like to thank my family for their patience and understanding during my frequent, and sometimes long, absences.
