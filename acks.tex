% Confucius said, ``\textit{lost time is never around the clock}''. Along my way to study physics during these years, I have received enormous encouragement and assistance from my family, my friends and my colleagues. I think it is the time to express my gratitude to all of them.
%
% First of all, I am very thankful to my supervisor, Prof. Carlos Herdeiro, for his support and inspiration, for teaching me how to work on physics and for giving me the freedom to explore my own interests.
%
% Special thanks are reserved for Marco Sampaio, for our enjoyable collaboration on various projects. As my co-supervisor, he has taught me a lot of physics and numerical techniques, while as a friend, his positiveness always reminds me to be optimistic when I face problems. I would also like to thank the other colleagues from the gravitation and high energy physics group at University of Aveiro, for all the great discussions about physics and others, they are Carolina Benone, Fl\'avio Coelho, Pedro Cunha, Juan Carlos Degollado, Jai Grover, Antonio Morais, Jo\~ao Rosa, Eugen Radu, and Helgi R\'unarsson. In particular, I am grateful to Juan Carlos Degollado and Jo\~ao Rosa for their interesting courses, and various discussions on the topic of superradiance.
%
% I would like to acknowledge the financial support from Funda\c{c}\~ao para a Ci\^encia e a Tecnologia (FCT)--the International Doctorate Network in Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology (IDPASC) programme, with the grant SFRH/BD/51648/2011 during the completion of this thesis.
%
% I owe my deepest gratitude to all my previous colleagues in China, especially Prof. Dezhi Huang, for encouraging me to work in a different field, and Prof. Jiliang Jing, for introducing me the black hole physics and supporting me to study aboard. I would also like to thank all my friends in China, who are too many to be listed individually, for their constant support. %I really miss the enjoyable time we had before, and I hope to see all of you soon.
%
% Finally, I would like to thank my parents, who teach me to be a virtuous man, and my sister, who is always on my side. Their endless love and support make me get better.
